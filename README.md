Patries
=======

Pastries is an HTML5 game built on a whim after I asked my kids what sort of game we should make. Rather than working on the game rules they wanted (below) I simply grabbed the smallest example I could find of an HTML5 game and ended up making a race between pastries. You have to tap a lot. My kids like to tap.

Implementation
--------------

I don't know much about making games, especially using HTML5. I googled for something like "create simple web game" and clicked https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games because I like Mozilla and MDN. Under "Tutorials" I found a page called "2D breakout game using Phaser" that said, "we've chosen Phaser as it is a good solid framework, with a good support and community available, and a good set of plugins." Good enough to me. My starting point was https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/v2.6.2/resources/tutorials/01%20Getting%20Started/hellophaser/index.html as described at http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game with some code sprinkled in from examples at http://phaser.io/examples

The game rules my kids wanted
-----------------------------

I didn't actually implement these rules my kids wanted yet because I have no idea what I'm doing:

- Tap a pie to get a coin.
- Tap a muffin to get two coins.
- At first, you only have a pie.
- You buy a muffin with the coins from a pie.
- A muffin costs 20 coins.
- Tap a cake to get 5 coins.
- A cake costs 100 coins.
